# learn-webpack
Webpack helps you managing dependencies in your project, and also offers a friendly and fast development environment, simplifying a lot of common tasks behind a simple configuration file. 

It also allows you to bundle your modules into static assets for browsers. Its killer feature is the known as hot module replacement, which lets your live code in the browser update automatically as you change files in your preferred editor without a page reload.

Unfortunately, webpack doc pages are not friendly enough for beginners like me. That's why I decided to create this repository: to help people to learn webpack with a collection of exercises and examples.

## How to use this repository
Navigate into the example folders to find out webpack configuration examples to help you get started with this module bundler. You will learn about the different configuration possibilities, from the simplest one to the most advanced configuration to deploy into production your bundles.

## How to start learning
After cloning this repository, you'll have to make a `npm install` under each example directory to install the required node dependencies for each example.

```
git clone git@github.com:danderu/learn-webpack.git
cd learn-webpack
cd some_example_directory
npm install
```

## How to collaborate
Please feel free to propose new examples or ask for help with any configuration you are trying to learn.
